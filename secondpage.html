	<div id="main"> All over the world there are about 65 million girls who are deprived of education. All these girls are forced to stay inside their house and the right to education is taken away from them. Education is said to be the vaccine for violence, it is said to be the solution to  the problem of poverty.Our India is a developing country. Moreover, it is one of the largest democracies. Since the day of Independence, our country has remarkable development in all the fields. And this was all possible because of the increase in education for all the genders. The gender equality took the country to new heights.
	

Furthermore, the involvement of women in all sectors has increased India’s growth rate. Now women are taking over every sector of society. That, in turn, is helping to expand our countries’ literacy rate.

Without any denial, we can say that women’s education is a major step toward success. Furthermore, from the day of the independence of women’s literacy rate is increasing. From 8.6% it is now at 64%. The success rate of the country in women’s literacy is quite high. But still, there are some reasons women are not able to emerge in a proper manner.

<h2>Setbacks of the Women Education System</h2>
Women’s literacy rate is increasing day by day but still due to some reasons the growth is hampering. The main reason for this is a crime against women. Various crimes against women take place every day. Because of which women are not able to roam freely on the roads.

Crimes like Rape, women trafficking, murders, abortion of a girl child are a shame for the country. Furthermore, these crimes are prevalent, though being us in the 21st Century. This is a huge setback for the growth of our country.</div>

Moreover, in some rural areas like small villages, girls are not allowed to go to school. They are confined at home to take care of the house. Because the people there still consider that women are only made to take care of the house by staying back at home. Also, gender discrimination and male superiority are still common.

Furthermore one of the main reasons for the reduced women literacy rate is the population of women in the entire country. In a recent survey, for 1000 men there were only 936 women. This represents the scarcity of female gender in our society. However, there are many steps that the government is taking to promote women’s education.
